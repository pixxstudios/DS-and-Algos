Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity, often O(n log n). Even other О(n^2) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, generally run faster than bubble sort, and are no more complex.
